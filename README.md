Spring-boot-docker

This project is just an example of a RESTful Web Service using Spring-boot and Docker.
It uses a JSON file as the database, which includes a collections of ids and names (ids range from 1 to 3, since this is just an example).
The Web Service has 2 routes:
- "/"
- "/[id]" - where id is a number between 1 and three
The result, which can be seen in a web browser, is in JSON format.
